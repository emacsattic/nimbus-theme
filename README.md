## About

Nimbus is a dark theme that I developed for my personal use. It's the only theme I ever use. I regularly add and modify faces and am always looking to support more third-party packages.

Nimbus was originally a fork of [Ample](https://github.com/jordonbiondo/ample-theme).

## Installing

Make sure you have set up [MELPA](http://melpa.org/#/getting-started) and run:

```
M-x package-install RET nimbus-theme RET
```

Use `M-x customize-themes` to activate it, or put the following in your Emacs configuration file:

```elisp
(load-theme 'nimbus t)
```

Or, if you have [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package):

```elisp
(use-package nimbus-theme)
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with Nimbus (such as text faces being hard to read or not appearing as expected), please try the following:

1. Restart Emacs and make sure Nimbus is the first theme you enable. Switching custom themes during an Emacs session may cause artifacts from the previous theme to remain.
1. Leave a bug report on [GitHub](https://github.com/m-cat/nimbus-theme/issues). Please try to include screenshots as well as full instructions for reproducing your problem, including setup of the relevant mode.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome. I want to support as many third-party Emacs packages as possible. Please write issues and raise pull requests!
